# UU Quarto presentation template

This is a template repository for creating a UU styled Quarto presentation. Quarto is an open source publishing system for creating (documentation) websites, presentations and books. Quarto allows you to write content using markdown, and you can create dynamic content using (among others) R and Python. Quarto will render your markdown(`.qmd`) or e.g. notebooks (`.ipynb`) to HTML, PDF, and more. 

This repository contains [UU themed presentation example slides] written in `.qmd` files.
